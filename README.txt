Note:
  Respecting the original, I verified the operation with M5Stack by minimal modification.
  Since it is not a robust code, I just uploaded the code for UNIT's healthness check.

Todo:
- Making the UI to run without debug serial connection.
- Looking for the datasheet of the unit in English or Japanese.
